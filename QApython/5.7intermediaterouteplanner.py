# You donâ€™t have to climb every peak. But you want to climb as many peaks as possible
# You only want to increase your altitude as going up and down would be too exhaustive.
# There is no going backwards.
# There can be more than one possible output.

# Enter your peaks:
# 0 8 4 12 2 10 6 14 1 9 5 13 3 11 7 15
# Best Route: 0 2 6 9 11 15
